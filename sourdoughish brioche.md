# Sourdough-ish Brioche

## Tangzhong
* 120g milk
* 50g bread flour 

* Mix together in a pot
* Cook at medium-high, whisking constantly
* When it forms a thick slurry, it's done
* Transfer to another bowl to cool

## Ingredients: 

* 120g milk
* 200g old starter
* Cooled tangzhong
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 4g salt
* 4g honey
* 100g sugar
* 450g bread flour
* 113g butter, softened but not melted
* Maybe 1 tsp yeast


## Recipe

1. Mix milk, starter, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla, honey, yeast
2. Mix tangzhong and flour in
3. Slowly add in butter
4. Knead until smooth - you need to knead brioche a heckin' lot
5. Rise for 2-3 hours, or wrap with saran wrap and rise overnight in the fridge
6. Preheat oven to 375 
7. Make your shapes (2 loaves default) and proof in baking dish while oven preheats
8. Bake for 40 min
9. Turn down heat and bake 350 for 10 min


You can: 
* Braid it 
* Make loafs
* Make buns
* Turn it into babka, with a filling

### Notes: 
* The tangzhong seems to help, it's lasted like five days and is still good as toast
* Definitely need to leave it in a greased bowl or ziploc overnight, this dough is very unruly even with the tangzhong - maybe increase the ratio? 
* This makes a buttload of brioche, consider halving it. Definitely need to double the apricot filling recipe if you're using it with this recipe straight.
