## Topping
* 60g butter, melted
* 100g brown sugar
* 8 - 10 pineapple slices
* 15 - 20 Maraschino cherries

### Directions
* Blot excess liquid off fruit
* Pour butter into ungreased 9x2 pie dish or round pan
* Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over butter
* Arrange fruit on top of brown sugar
* Refrigerate until needed


## Cake
* 177g cake flour (cake flour is important)
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 85g butter, softened
* 150g white sugar
* 16g egg white protein (or just 2 egg whites)
* 80g sour cream
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 160g milk, ideally whole (80g if using whole egg whites)

### Directions

* Preheat oven to 350&deg;
* Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt
* Whip butter until fluffy
* Cream sugar into butter
* Mix in egg whites, sour cream and vanilla, whip until smooth and fluffy-ish
* Sift in dry ingredients
* Cut together gently
* Add milk, mix until just combined (do not over mix)
* Pour gently over topping, spread with spatula
* Tent foil over cake
* Bake for ~45 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 200&deg;. 
* Cool for 20 minutes 
* Invert and potentially serve (the cooler it gets the less messy it will be)

## Notes

* Cake was great, but the fruits slowly made it collapse. Probably best if cooked separately and then put fruits on it after it cools completely, but even then it's likely to collapse.
