## Chiffon Cake
From https://www.justonecookbook.com/perfect-chiffon-cake/
### Ingredients:
* 5 large eggs
* 85 g granulated sugar for whites
* 45 g granulated sugar for yolks
* 55 g vegetable oil
* 95 g water/milk/citrus juice / other flavoring (mostly water)
* 120 g cake flour - must be cake flour
* 6 g baking powder
* 8 g vanilla extract

### Instructions
* Preheat oven to 340&deg;
* Separate eggs into yolks + whites
* Put whites into freezer for at least 15 minutes (it's okay if they're a little frozen) - use a ceramic bowl to maintain the coolness
* Pour 45 g of sugar into yolks, mix well
* Pour flavoring & vanilla into yolks, mix well
* Sift flour and baking powder into yolks, mix until just incorporated
* Take out whites, whisk until opaque foamy and bubbly
* Gradually add 85g of sugar while whisking
* Whisk until stiff peaks
* Whisk 1/3rd of whites gently into yolk batter until homogenous
* Fold another 1/3rd of whites gently into yolk batter
* Transfer yolk batter into bowl with whites, fold gently
* Pour into ungreased cake pan - don't move the pour location around to prevent air bubbles
* Poke skewer into batter to kill any air pockets, then drop pan against counter a few times
* Bake 35-40 minutes, until internal temperature is ~190 &deg;
* Bang cake against counter again once it comes out
* Let cool upside-down for at least an hour
* Run a thin knife or something around the inner and outer edges of the cake, then around the bottom once it comes out
* Remove from pan, add topping
  * Powdered sugar is generally not enough for the American palate, put a powdered sugar + liquid + flavoring sauce on it. Fresh fruit works great as well.

### Notes:

#### Attempt 1

Flavoring: 15 g cocoa powder, 15 g baker's dry milk, 65g milk - lightly chocolate cake

Worked very well in the NordicWare 9ish in angel food cake tin despite the recipe being scaled for an 8in tin

Needed some sort of sauce, so I did 60g powdered sugar 40g baker's dry milk + real milk until the consistency was right.

#### Attempt 2

Flavoring: 70g orange juice, 25g lemon juice, 3/4 tsp ground cardamom, 15g orange zest, 5 g lemon zest
Frosting: 210 g powdered sugar, 60 grams orange juice, 1 tbsp orange zest, 5g butter

Was very good, seemed moister than the other cake on its own. Frosting was a bit too sweet for some.
