## No Knead Multigrain
### Ingredients: 
#### Tangzhong: 
* 150g boiling water
* 75g all-purpose flour

1. Whisk all purpose flour into boiling water (doing water into flour makes it lumpy)

#### Bread:
* Tangzhong (cooled enough that it doesn't hurt the yeast)
* 250g lukewarm water
* 40g honey, brown rice syrup or molasses
* 10g fine sea salt
* 30g olive oil
* 5g yeast
* 200g starter
* 75g all-purpose flour
* 120g whole-wheat flour
* 100g rye flour
* 15g wheat bran
* 50g flax seeds
* 25g millet
* 100g multigrain cereal, such as Bobâ€™s Red Mill 8-grain cereal
* 20g chia seeds (ran out of multigrain, added chia seeds to make up for it)

### Recipe

1. Mix everything together in order 
2. Cover with plastic wrap, let it ferment & rise in the fridge for 12 to 20 hours
3. Line a 9x5 ish loaf pan with parchment paper
7. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel, let rise 60-90 min
8. Preheat oven to 450&deg;F for 30 min
9. Uncover loaf pan, cover with aluminum foil (the bread will grow some, so make sure to leave room)
11. Bake with aluminum foil lid on for 25-30 min
12. Bake lid off for 25-45 min until internal temp is ~200&deg;F
13. Cool 1 hour

# Notes
* Nice and light and fluffy, but started fermenting / going bad within five days
* Did that again! Will try w/ less water and without the tangzhong
* Chia seeds are kinda annoying and get stuck in your teeth, do not recommend for bread
