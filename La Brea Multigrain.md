17. Uncover, rotate, bake another 25 min rotating occasionally
18. Optionally, reduce heat to 450 if bread is getting too dark

### Notes

- used a heckin' lot more water, and it could probably use even more
- probably want to add 1:1 water:wheat bran if you add it
- did not actually come out significantly fluffier, but texture does seem nicer (possibly due to the soak?)
- not sure if soaking the whole wheat or the bran helped more
