## Ingredients: 

Note: if using one of those pre-made pie crusts in an aluminum tin, halve this recipe and bake towards the lower end

* 100g butter
* 55g bittersweet chocolate
* 5g cocoa powder

* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 170h pecans

* 9 inch pie crust in a 9 inch pie tin

## Recipe

* Preheat oven to 350&deg; F
* Put chocolate, cocoa powder and butter into a metal thing
* Do a hot water bath to melt them all together
* Let cool
* Mix together, in more or less this order: 
* * Eggs, white & brown sugars, flour, vanilla, salt, chocolate mixture (be sure to temper eggs if mixture is still hot), pecans
* Pour in a 9 inch pie tin with pie crust
* Bake at 350&deg; F for 30 to 40 minutes, until the filling is just set when the pan is jiggled. 

## Notes for this version

Flavor was pretty correct, but texture was entirely wrong - more like a chess pie. Probably omit flour if using date sugar.
