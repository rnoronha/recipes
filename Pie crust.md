https://www.inspiredtaste.net/22662/flaky-pie-crust-recipe/ - essentially make a beurre manie and then add more flour to it

## Beurre manie: 
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp sugar (optional, for sweet crusts)
* 120 g flour (1 cup nominal)
* 230 g cold butter (1 cup nominal)

## Recipe: 
1. Add salt, sugar, flour to food processor
2. Pulse a couple of times to mix
3. Add butter 
4. Process until a paste forms
5. Optionally refrigerate if it's a hot day or the paste has otherwise gotten too warm; if you do so, you'll want to refrigerate into a mostly flat shape. 

## Pie crust
* Beurre manie (about 2 cups)
* 180 g flour
* Ice water in excess (4-8 tbsp)

## Recipe 
1. Spread beurre manie around food processor bowl
2. Add flour
3. Pulse a few times to mix - should look like biscuit dough / fine sand / that weird silicone sand they had at the sharper image
4. Turn out into a bowl
5. Sprinkle 4tbsp ice water over mixture
6. Try to fold dough together; it should just barely form large clumps and hold together
7. If dough won't hold together, add more ice water 1 tbsp at a time
8. Cut in half, then save each; 3 days in the fridge or 3 months in the freezer.
