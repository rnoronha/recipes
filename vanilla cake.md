# Vanilla Cake
Using the vanilla cake from the pineapple upside-down cake recipe, but baking it chiffon style. 

Also I'm gonna put sprinkles and condensed milk in it

## Cake
* 85g butter, softened
* 150g white sugar
* 16g egg white protein
* 80g sour cream
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 100g chocolate sprinkles (the good ones, like the kind you'd put on hagelslag)
* 60g condensed milk

* 177g cake flour (cake flour is important)
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda

* 100g milk, ideally whole

### Directions

* Preheat oven to 350&deg;
* Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda
* Whip butter until fluffy
* Cream sugar into butter
* Mix in egg whites
* Mix in sour cream, vanilla, salt, whip until smooth and fluffy-ish
* Add chocolate sprinkles
* Sift in dry ingredients
* Cut together gently
* Add milk, mix until just combined (do not over mix)
* Pour gently into 7 inch chiffon cake pan
* Bake for ~40 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 200&deg;. 
* Invert for upside-down cooling
* Cool for 20 minutes 

## Notes

* Very delicate and soft
* A bit dry - maybe more butter & stir less
* A bit overcooked in the outer corner
* Chocolate sprinkles probably added too much sugar; go for mini-chips? The batter is thick enough to suspend them.
